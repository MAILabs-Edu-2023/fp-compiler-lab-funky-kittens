# FGO - Functional GO

Our team is go developers, so we decided to fantasize on the topic: 
> What if Go was a purely functional language?

For daily development in Go, many functional elements are missing: `Optional[T]`, slice operations like `Map` and `Flatten`, `Pair[L, R]` and so on.

Yes, it **go**es against Go Way =)

## Syntax

Vars

Functions

Etc

## Code samples

```
...
